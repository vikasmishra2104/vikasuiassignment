I Created a HTML page showing a list of users in a tabular format.
The data is populated from a JSON stored in code.
By default, the page will open with just a button saying 'Load data'. 
Clicking on that button will show the data.
After that, the button will change to 'Refresh data'.
The columns  in UI are - First name, Middle name, Last name, email, phone number, role, address. 
Last column  have 2 buttons saying 'Edit' and 'Delete'. 
Clicking on Edit  make the row editable, with Save and Cancel button at last column. Save click is keeping the changes in UI.
cancel will revert it back.
Delete will just remove the row from UI.
Refresh data is just reloading the data again
